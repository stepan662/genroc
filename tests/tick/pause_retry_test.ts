/**
 * Tests that observe how pausing interacts with on_error retries.
 *
 * The point of these is the difference between resuming and retrying. Pausing an
 * instance that is sitting on a scheduled retry does not spend, skip or reset that
 * retry — the attempt the definition granted is still there when the process resumes.
 * Retrying, by contrast, is only for a process that already failed, and hands it an
 * attempt beyond its on_error budget.
 *
 * Three scenarios:
 *
 *   1. Pause issued while a retry is still pending
 *      → the instance parks in 'paused' with its retry intact; ticks do nothing while
 *        it is paused; resuming runs exactly that pending attempt.
 *
 *   2. All retries exhausted before any pause
 *      → the final failed attempt calls failInstance(); status is 'failed', and
 *        pausing a settled process is rejected.
 *
 *   3. retry on a paused process is rejected
 *      → the two verbs are not interchangeable; the error points at resume.
 *
 * Both processes run as root instances (no tree) so the timing is straightforward.
 * The server is started with --immediate-retries so retries are claimable on the
 * very next tick, with no backoff delay to wait for.
