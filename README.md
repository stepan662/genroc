# genroc

A durable process orchestrator. You describe a process as a set of tasks in YAML
(or JSON); genroc runs each instance to completion, surviving worker crashes,
restarts, and long waits without holding a thread or losing state.

Every task checkpoints to a database before and after it runs, so an instance can
be picked up by any worker at any time. Long-running work — polling a remote job,
waiting on a human, backing off between retries — parks in the database and holds
no worker while it waits.

## What it gives you

- **Crash-safe execution.** Instances are leased to workers; a crashed worker's
  lease expires and another worker resumes exactly where it left off.
- **Structural control flow.** Tasks route with `switch` (`next` / `end` /
  `$goto` / conditional cases). There is no `while`/`until` — loops are expressed
  by routing back to an earlier task, which keeps every iteration a crash-safe
  checkpoint (see [examples/polling-task](examples/polling-task)).
- **Child processes.** A task can spawn keyed (`child_map`) or fan-out
  (`child_list`) child processes and wait for them, with versioning and
  compatibility checks between parent and child.
- **External tasks.** A task can hand off to a human or a long-running external
  system (`external`) and resume when the result is signalled back in.
- **Typed data flow.** Process input, task outputs, and child results are
  described with a strict JSON-Schema subset, and output types are *inferred* —
  including recursive shapes (see [docs/recursive-type-inference.md](docs/recursive-type-inference.md)).
- **Config vars & secrets.** Per-process / global config is read from the
  environment (`GENROC_<PROCESS>_<NAME>`, `GENROC_GLOBAL_<NAME>`); values marked
  `secret` are redacted from logs.
- **Versioning & channels.** Definitions are versioned; named channels (e.g.
  `latest`) point at a version and can be promoted.
- **Per-instance logs**, pagination, and filtering across the API.
- **Two storage engines.** SQLite (single file, default) or PostgreSQL
  (production, concurrent workers) — same SQL, chosen at startup.

## Binaries

| Binary       | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `genroc`     | The server: runs the engine and serves the API over HTTP / TCP / Unix socket. |
| `genctl`     | Command-line client for a running server (apply, run, inspect, logs, pause/resume/retry), inspired by kubectl. |
| `genrocspec` | Emits the server's OpenAPI spec (`openapi.json`). |

## Quickstart

```sh
make build            # produces ./genroc and ./genctl

# Run the server with SQLite (default):
./genroc -db genroc.db

# ...or with PostgreSQL:
./genroc -pg postgres://user:pass@localhost/genroc
```

The server listens on `:8448` by default (`-http`, `-tcp`, `-uds` to configure).
Point `genctl` at it with `GENROC_SERVER` (default `http://localhost:8448`).

Define a process — a minimal `greet.genroc.yaml`:

```yaml
name: greet
input_schema:
  type: object
  properties:
    url:  { type: string }
    name: { type: string }
  required: [url, name]
tasks:
  - id: call
    action:
      type: fetch                       # an HTTP call; every field is an expression
      url: "{{ input.url }}/hello"
      body:
        greeting: "Hello, {{ input.name }}"
      result_schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          ok: { type: boolean }
        required: [ok]
    output: "{{ self.result }}"
    switch: end
```

Apply and run it:

```sh
genctl apply -f greet.genroc.yaml
genctl run greet --set url=https://api.example.com --set name=World
genctl get @last          # inspect the most recent instance
genctl logs @last         # its per-instance logs
```

See [examples/polling-task](examples/polling-task) for a fuller example — a parent
that spawns a child process which polls a remote job until it finishes, is
cancelled, or exhausts its attempt budget.

## Development

```sh
make build      # build (runs sqlc first)
make test       # go unit tests + TypeScript integration tests
make run        # build and run locally
make swagger    # regenerate openapi.json via genrocspec
```

Persistence is split between **sqlc-generated** queries (from
`internal/db/queries.sql`) and a small set of hand-written dual-engine queries.
All SQL must compile against both SQLite and PostgreSQL — see
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the database conventions (adding a query, adding a
migration, the dual-engine rules). Run the DB tests against Postgres with:

```sh
POSTGRES_DSN=postgres://user:pass@localhost/genroc go test ./internal/db/...
```

## Layout
