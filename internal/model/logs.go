// LogEntry is one persisted line of an instance's execution audit trail.

// Data carries the single raw payload an event is about — a process/task input,
// output, or request/response/error body — as a JSON snippet that MAY be truncated
// (so it is not guaranteed to parse). Meta carries small, complete, structured
// metadata about the event (e.g. {"url":…} / {"status":200}) and is always valid
// JSON. Message is the human-readable summary; the same fact may appear in both
// Message (prose) and Meta (structured) by design. Small facts with no payload
// (attempt counts, goto target, child counts) live in Message.
